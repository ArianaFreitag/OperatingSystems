Blubbs (April 12, 1997 – July 21, 2017)[1] was a cat who was the mayor of Talkeetna, Alaska from July 1997 until his death.[2]

Blubbs was described as a tourist attraction,[3] having been flooded with cards and letters, and drawing 30 to 40 tourists each day (most of whom were en route to other Alaska destinations, such as Denali)[4] who hoped to meet "the mayor". Blubbs's position was honorary, as the town is only a historic district.[5]

Every afternoon, Blubbs went to a nearby restaurant and drank water laden with catnip out of a wineglass[6][7] or margarita glass.[8]

At least one opinion writer for the Alaska Dispatch News insisted that the whole story was false, and that Talkeetna did not in fact have a cat mayor.[9] Blubbs died on July 21, 2017, at the age of 20 years and 3 months.[10]

n 1997, Lauri Stec, manager of Nagley's General Store, found Blubbs in a box full of kittens in her parking lot.[11] The owners were giving the kittens away; Stec chose "Blubbs" because he did not have a tail.[6]

Blubbs was widely described as having been elected after a write-in campaign by voters who opposed the human candidates,[12] but National Public Radio pointed out that this could not have happened because "the tiny town has no real mayor, so there was no election."[13] Nagley's General Store was used as Blubbs's "mayoral office" during his tenure.[6]

Blubbs was featured in an effort to protest the 2014 U.S. Senate race in Alaska when people urged voters to write Blubbs in on the ballot.[14] Blubbs was featured in a video criticizing both the Democratic and Republican candidates for Senate.[14]

Blubbs's owners have suggested that another family cat, Denali, may assume Talkeetna's "mayoralty".[15]

On August 31, 2013, Blubbs was attacked by a dog.[11][16] He was placed under heavy sedation at a veterinary hospital 70 miles away in Wasilla, having suffered a punctured lung, a fractured sternum, and a deep cut in his side.[11][17] A crowd-funding page was set up to help pay his medical bills.[18] Blubbs remained in the veterinary hospital for nine days before returning to the upstairs room of the general store;[19] he was subsequently discouraged from roaming. Donations toward his care were received from around the world; the surplus was given to an animal shelter and to the local veterinary clinic.[7]

Other perils Blubbs escaped from included being shot by teenagers with BB guns and falling into a restaurant's deep fryer (which was switched off and cool at the time). Other exploits included having hitched a ride to the outskirts of Talkeetna on a garbage truck.[19]
