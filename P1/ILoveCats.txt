Casper (c. 1997 – 14 January 2010[1]) was a male domestic cat who attracted worldwide media attention in 2009 when it was reported that he was a regular bus commuter in Plymouth in Devon, England.[2] He appeared on BBC News,[3] was the subject of a newspaper editorial in The Guardian,[4] and had a book written about him, Casper the Commuting Cat.[2] Casper died on 14 January 2010 after being hit by a taxi.[1]
Casper was adopted from an animal rescue centre in Weymouth, Dorset in 2002 by Susan Finden, a 48-year-old health care worker.[5][6] He had been at the centre for about ten months and the owners called him Morse, after Inspector Morse, a TV program they had been watching when he arrived.[7] But after a few days with him in her Weymouth house, Finden changed his name to Casper, after Casper the Friendly Ghost, because he kept disappearing.[5][8] She soon realised that he was a very independent and determined cat, and he frequently wandered off. She also discovered that he was not afraid of people or traffic, and seemed to love being around large vehicles,[6] leading her to believe that Casper may have been brought up in a haulage yard.[8] It was not long before she started hearing reports that he was visiting nearby office blocks, doctor's consulting rooms and pharmacies.[3] Fearing for his safety while crossing roads, Finden tried to keep Casper locked indoors, but he always found a way out.[9]

In 2006, Finden moved to Plymouth, Devon,[9] and when she went to work each day she had no idea what Casper did while she was away. It was not until early 2009 that she discovered that he was riding on buses.[1] The drivers told her that he would politely queue along with other passengers at the bus stop opposite her house, and when a bus came that he liked, he would get on and jump on his favourite seat.[6] Casper would remain on the bus for its 11-mile (18 km) round-trip to the city centre and back to the bus stop opposite his house, where the drivers would let him exit, ensuring that he did not get off at any other stop.[3][1][10] When Finden learned of Casper's bus excursions, she contacted the bus company, First Devon & Cornwall, who alerted their drivers to be on the lookout for him. She was touched by how the drivers and passengers went out of their way to accommodate Casper and his unusual behaviour, and wrote a letter to The Plymouth Herald thanking them for their kindness. Her letter led to The Herald publishing an article on Casper in April 2009. British news agencies picked up The Herald article, and Casper's story quickly spread nationally, and then internationally.[1]

Casper became a celebrity and appeared in newspapers and on websites across the world.[3][11] He featured on BBC News, who had filmed him boarding a bus.[3] First Devon & Cornwall adorned the side of some of their buses with a huge picture of Casper, and said they had no intention of charging Casper a bus fare. Public-relations manager, Karen Baxter said: "In cat years he's an OAP so he'd get a free bus pass anyway".[5]
On 14 January 2010, Casper was hit by a taxi, which did not stop to help him. He died of his injuries before Finden could get him to a vet.[8] News of the accident spread quickly around the world, with some newspapers calling it a hit and run.[1][10] Finden later contacted the taxi company, but could not press charges as British traffic regulations do not make it mandatory for drivers to stop after hitting a cat (although they must stop after hitting a dog).[12] She had Casper cremated at a vet's crematorium,[13] but she did not keep his ashes, as she had never kept the ashes of any of her other cats.[14] Plymouth bus drivers and passengers who knew Casper paid tribute to him, and Finden posted a notice at his bus stop:

“	Many local people knew Casper, who loved everyone. He also enjoyed the bus journeys. Sadly a motorist hit him … and did not stop. Casper died from his injuries. He will be greatly missed ... he was a much-loved pet who had so much character. Thank you to all those who befriended him.[1]	”
Finden also received condolences from all over the world, including Australia, Argentina, Indonesia and the United States.[3][15] The Guardian wrote in an editorial entitled "In praise of… Casper the commuting cat": "Casper had a thing about HGVs, but otherwise little road sense. That could have been his undoing. But, all things considered, what a ride it was."[4]

Stubbs (April 12, 1997 – July 21, 2017)[1] was a cat who was the mayor of Talkeetna, Alaska from July 1997 until his death.[2]

Stubbs was described as a tourist attraction,[3] having been flooded with cards and letters, and drawing 30 to 40 tourists each day (most of whom were en route to other Alaska destinations, such as Denali)[4] who hoped to meet "the mayor". Stubbs's position was honorary, as the town is only a historic district.[5]

Every afternoon, Stubbs went to a nearby restaurant and drank water laden with catnip out of a wineglass[6][7] or margarita glass.[8]

At least one opinion writer for the Alaska Dispatch News insisted that the whole story was false, and that Talkeetna did not in fact have a cat mayor.[9] Stubbs died on July 21, 2017, at the age of 20 years and 3 months.[10]

n 1997, Lauri Stec, manager of Nagley's General Store, found Stubbs in a box full of kittens in her parking lot.[11] The owners were giving the kittens away; Stec chose "Stubbs" because he did not have a tail.[6]

Stubbs was widely described as having been elected after a write-in campaign by voters who opposed the human candidates,[12] but National Public Radio pointed out that this could not have happened because "the tiny town has no real mayor, so there was no election."[13] Nagley's General Store was used as Stubbs's "mayoral office" during his tenure.[6]

Stubbs was featured in an effort to protest the 2014 U.S. Senate race in Alaska when people urged voters to write Stubbs in on the ballot.[14] Stubbs was featured in a video criticizing both the Democratic and Republican candidates for Senate.[14]

Stubbs's owners have suggested that another family cat, Denali, may assume Talkeetna's "mayoralty".[15]

On August 31, 2013, Stubbs was attacked by a dog.[11][16] He was placed under heavy sedation at a veterinary hospital 70 miles away in Wasilla, having suffered a punctured lung, a fractured sternum, and a deep cut in his side.[11][17] A crowd-funding page was set up to help pay his medical bills.[18] Stubbs remained in the veterinary hospital for nine days before returning to the upstairs room of the general store;[19] he was subsequently discouraged from roaming. Donations toward his care were received from around the world; the surplus was given to an animal shelter and to the local veterinary clinic.[7]

Other perils Stubbs escaped from included being shot by teenagers with BB guns and falling into a restaurant's deep fryer (which was switched off and cool at the time). Other exploits included having hitched a ride to the outskirts of Talkeetna on a garbage truck.[19]
